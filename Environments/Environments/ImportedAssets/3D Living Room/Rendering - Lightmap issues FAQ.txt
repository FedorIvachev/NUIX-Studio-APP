Here is a quick FAQ to avoid "waste of time" emails :
-----------------------------------------------------

"I want more bling bling shininess? How i can?"

- Simply :) Select all textures material and remove the metal map, sliders appears! Enjoy.


"I don't understand? I don't get the same rendering as your?"

- It's normal! Unity don't like move lightmap informations between different machines... 

  To solve it you need first : Clear the GI cache (preferences), next delete the directory
  created with the same name as the scene, example, if the scene is called "Example" delete
  the directory "Example" (containing the lightmap datas), next recompute lightmaps!

  
"I don't like the stylish, please refund!" 

- Lol... The stylish is clearly displayed via videos or screenshoot... Don't try! :)


"The product do not fit "my need" (or stylish...), please refund, or i give you a bad review!"

- Lol... The return... You will immediately spotted to unity by an email from me...
  The product is clear, this space is a virtual 3D shop, with prefabs...
